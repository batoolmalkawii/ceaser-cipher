# Ceaser Cipher

In this project, we worked on a well-know cryptographic class - the Caesar Cipher.


### Feature Tasks and Requirements
* `encrypt`: takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric shift. The phrase will then be shifted that many letters, shifts that exceed 26 should wrap around.
* `decrypt`: takes in encrypted text and numeric shift which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form as long as correct key is supplied.
* `break_cipher`: Break the cipher so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state WITHOUT access to the key.
* `is_english`: Returns the number of english words in a sentence.
